# Database connection

My database is already hosted using the Google Cloud platform if you want to connect to mine send me a message with you ip adress so I can give you acces and the app will automatically connect to mine.

The other way is to start any sort of postgres database locally and just change the `DATABASE_URL` field in `.env` file.  The app will automatically connec to the new database and create the schema there.
